# Complex Select Dropdown Menu

## Technologies used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

## Description

First of all, this is a working in progress.

This is one of my biggest challenges in 2023, when I had to implement a component that behaves like a custom HTML Select component, but with a lot of customizations. The customizations include:

- Custom dropdown
- Items selection
- Options filtering with a text input
- Variants:
  - Single selection (To be implemented);
  - Multiple selection;
  - Options grouped by an Accordion.

## How to run

Although this project uses Vite, the component could be viewed in Storybook. To run it, just run the following commands and the browser will open on `localhost:6006`:

```bash
npm install
npm run storybook
```
