## Description

First of all, this is a working in progress.

This is one of my biggest challenges in 2023, when I had to implement a component that behaves like a custom HTML Select component, but with a lot of customizations. The customizations include:

- Custom dropdown
- Items selection
- Options filtering with a text input
- Variants:
  - Single selection;
  - Multiple selection;
  - Options grouped by an Accordion.
